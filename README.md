Weather App

This is a simple weather app that uses geolocation API and Openweahtermap API to get latest data about weather.
You can either check it out at the deployment in github pages or install the extension version present in the ExtensionVer branch.
(Extentions can be installed on any browser by going to Manage Extensions, Turning on Developer mode and then choosing Load Unpacked. There select the folder containing all the files and the extension will be available.)
The extension version uses location permissions so be sure to enable that when prompted.
